# How to dynamically update chart data (a "Performance Monitor" application)


<p>How to dynamically update chart data (a "Performance Monitor" application)</p><p>This example describes how to create a "Performance Monitor" application with the help of our ChartControl. The key principals of this real-life application include:<br />
- the SystemPerformanceCounters class that encapsulates the logic for all performance counters within the operating system;<br />
- the appropriate adjustment of the ChartControl instance that dynamically accepts current values of selected performance counters within a particular performance category. </p><p>For more information about performance counters, please refer to the<a href="ms-help://MS.MSDNQTR.v80.en/MS.MSDN.v80/MS.NETDEVFX.v20.en/dv_fxgenref/html/06a4ae8c-eeb2-4d5a-817e-b1b95c0653e1.htm">Performance Counters in the .NET Framework</a> in VS help collection.</p>
